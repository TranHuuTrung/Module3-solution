                <p>Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid 
                    and take up the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins,
                    of course) for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section
                    really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its
                    height to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause 
                    scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section.
                    Make sure its background color is set to distinguish it from the 
                    rest of the content. (Hint: don't forget to have an element with a 
                    class='container' or class='container-fluid' wrapping your grid.
                    Remember that to have the grid do something "always", i.e., no matter
                    what browser window size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case,
                    since we want the section to take up the entire row, use col-xs-12.)
